I hate how my monitor flickers whenever I initialize PyTorch MPS haha

Here's a fun optimization that Clang doesn't seem to get: turning mask and then equality test into greater than test. https://godbolt.org/z/356aferaW The two functions are equivalent: https://alive2.llvm.org/ce/z/CGtuo7

Fabio Rocha wants to know: what's your favorite compilers book? (Online resources good too!) The context is he is trying to better understand torchinductor, but tbh we probably need to just write a paper about it lol

Hey compiler twitter, you need a naming scheme like uint{8,16,32} for a sequence of bits, where they have no semantic meaning (e.g., they're not unsigned/signed ints, they're just bytes.) What would you call it? byteX has connotations of uint which is annoying.

@tousifsays I don't think I mean arbitrary precision? I want users to shove random crap in the bits like posits or fp8

the debugger is not my preferred way of finding bugs, but for an unfamiliar codebase it sure is a hell of a drug

@feeler_21 My favorite is "debug by reading code until you see the bug", I also like "read print statements until you see the bug"

@Phairupegiont Well I mean sometimes you gotta run optimized C++ without debug symbols, good luck single stepping through that lol

Technical barriers: no one else can actually write the code. Maybe the system is extremely complicated or the problem space requires a domain expert. You could be specialist (you need a PhD in X) or generalist (you need to know how multiple complicated systems work together)

As a staff engineer, you are expected to solve impactful problems that no one else can solve. For problems that can be solved via CODING, are you more likely to be breaking down a technical barrier or an organizational barrier? (Choices described more downthread.)

When it comes to the XFN and people parts of the staff engineer job, you probably spend a lot of time helping solve organizational problems (esp the higher you go.) But when you find the time to code, I want to know which problem you break down.

Organizational barriers are code that, if you put a gun to someone's head, they could write it. But for some reason, they don't. Maybe it doesn't look good on perf, or it's really boring to do, or there's too much. See also the "bulldozer method": https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1570298244516974592

The best thing about writing up answers to questions you have, is that a year later, when you have the same question you can just lookup your old post. I like to comment on the post whenever I go back to it; my PyTorch ASAN setup post is already a three-timer

For NON-security bugs, does it make sense to fuzz for more bugs even if you have known bugs that haven't yet been fixed?

For the purposes of the question, assume that you have enough known bugs that the team could go full time fixing bugs without bottlenecking on lack of bugs.
