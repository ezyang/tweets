I really like the analogy of "git rebase" being a mechanism of moving history from short term memory to long term memory.

@placidex Rebase rewrites history; similarly, your brain rewrites and consolidates short term memories when moving them long term. This rewriting is beneficial, and leads to more useful long term memory, as opposed to git merge which does no rewriting.

Has anyone worked through a full language with YOLO effect typing for reference cells: if a function type mentions a reference cell anywhere in its signature, it's considered having read/write effects?

Such a language is obviously conservative (e.g., it will classify fn (x : ref int) -&gt; x as effectful) but, I dunno, might still be useful?

All of you working on effect type systems: does the IR you optimize over also have effect types? Or does it all turn back into token passing?

@BrandonBloom Sure, I am just not sure the PL community has a term for “safe to run speculatively, repeatedly, and/or out of order” besides "effectful." And I am very interested in how to negotiate this design in an IR. I know how GHC does it. What about others?

@BrandonBloom You might be reading too much into my claim. GHC's all real world token passing. If you know an effect is benign, you whip a real world token from thin air and get the horses going.
