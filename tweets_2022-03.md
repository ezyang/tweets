@francoisfleuret @PyTorch Vmap transform can be done locally so we do it on the fly as we eagerly execute. Actually, JAX does the same thing too!

@sigfpe One thing I've noticed while we worked on functorch is that you often can get away with not reifying the AST, sort of tagless interpreter style, which is good if you're trying to also support reasonably efficient eager mode

@froystig @sigfpe I find this is one of the most interesting differences between PyTorch and JAX autograd. JAX stages out while PyTorch manually implements the tape. No diff if you trace through; it's an implementation complexity vs efficiency tradeoff.

@froystig @sigfpe PyTorch double backwards also occupies a weird alternative design niche, where instead of stacking AD transforms you shove everything on the same tape and it works out (sort of like macros which expand to more occurrences of themselves)

@froystig @sigfpe Separately, it makes me wonder if you can take the compiler (JAX style stage out), and automatically transform it into an efficient interpreter

JAX transforms done with Python mixins is awkward: (1) self.add(x,y) is footgun (typically want Class.add(self,x,y)), (2) base dedupe means you need to clone classes; encapsulating clones from each other is awkward

Interested in how functorch works? Check out Simple Functorch https://github.com/albanD/subclass_zoo/blob/main/simple_functorch.ipynb an implementation of functorch entirely in Python. (With a lot of inspiration from https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autodidax.html)

@SingularMattrix @froystig @sigfpe It‚Äôs gone into detail in Simple Functorch, but the short version is traditional PyTorch AD only ever has one tape no matter how many backwards you run, and I /think/ JAX ends up with multiple tapes (at least functorch does)

@SingularMattrix @froystig @sigfpe It‚Äôs possible this is a misunderstanding though, because jaxprs are an initial representation that can get transformed over, whereas PyTorch tape are finally tagless callables; higher order still breaks my brain

In Haskell, given a function you can have the type checker infer the most general type signature for it, or you can explicitly give a polymorphic signature and check if you assumed more constraints. Is there a fancier name for this second process than just "checking"?

I guess, another way to put it is, what vocabulary distinguishes an assert that says "this should be provable from the context" versus an assert that's "I have some external knowledge that this is true and you should rely on it"
