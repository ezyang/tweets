Writing good docs is pretty time consuming. Like most writing, I suppose.

Time travel as a perceptual phenomenon, rather than a physical one

Nothing worse than a build tool that doesn't do incremental recompilation

@pkhuong should just call it santa locking instead

@MarisaVeryMoe Gets a lot simpler when there isn't mutation :)

That feeling when you suggest how to fix a problem, and then you don't even need to be a code reviewer for the resulting diff :&gt;

Gradual typing has a superficial resemblance to subtyping, in that people might say that int &lt;: Any. But typing rules for Any are different than rules for Top. Can you "gradually type" the entire subtyping hierarchy; e.g., have a concept of AnyInt? Has this been explored?

Here is a sketch. Superimpose two type systems. First is conventional int &lt;: object system with gradually typed Any. Second applies only to ints, and adds the refinement Literal[n] &lt;: int with gradually typed IntAny.

@samth Thanks, it seems relevant. The context: machine learning community interested in explicitly size-indexing their tensor types (Tensor[n, m]), but don't want to do it all in one go, want it gradually typed.

@dimvar The interaction is pretty weird though. Shouldn't allow AnyInt to be used as bool. Maybe it all works out in the end? I would love to see it worked out somewhere though

@TaReven Imagine you have overlaid two type systems on your program. You first do normal typechecking with any and int. Once you're all done, you do second typechecking with IntAny, but only on the int fragments of the program.
