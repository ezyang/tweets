Half of the time being an OSS maintainer is just giving people permission to do things

It is amazing how poorly abstracted the code people write is when the program doesn't take any user input. Overfitting to an extreme. (The "input" is evolution to the program spec over time.)

Suppose you are in a situation where you need to duplicate a substantial codebase in two languages and then keep them in sync over changes. How much work would it be to use an LLM to do the synchronization

...TBH, most of the work is probably just setting up the language-language pairs in a useful way haha (with alignment at the, IDK, function level? Or maybe even statement level)

@repligate Yeah, based on our experience Copilot is good at the initial conversion, and so I'm really wondering, how much more to get syncing haha

@pavpanchekha @BrowserBook Well, even if you're porting by hand, you're going to have to have some sort of testing strategy for the ported code haha. Not sure I would expect humans to get this right all the time either!

@pavpanchekha @BrowserBook I guess I was kind of imagining that you check in the two outputs; if the LLM messes up you edit the output to make it right, and that edit becomes part of subsequent prompts. Not sure if this would actually work though!

My new favorite sampling profiler is sending SIGUSR1 to my process every two seconds and having it print the backtrace it is in at the moment lol

It is nice to see that you do not have to use a 2011 perl script to generate flame graphs anymore; there's also a Rust port!

@thingskatedid @johnregehr @robinhouston @IoOrBust Having to implement B's algo from scratch probably set my PhD thesis back a few months lol (mostly because I kept procrastinating ways to not have to do it)

@thingskatedid @johnregehr @robinhouston @IoOrBust WAIT A SECOND I didn't do B's algo in the end, for some reason I decided I had to do Hopcroft's instead LOL

@thingskatedid @johnregehr @robinhouston @IoOrBust I don't remember, maybe I should have done a reverse ðŸ˜­ I wasn't actually minimizing a DFA though, it was more like an AST representing a fixpoint equation, so maybe there wasn't an obvious way to reverse it

The punchline is I never actually implemented Hopcroft's in Haskell, I just dumped recursive modules lol

That moment when it takes longer to rebuild your binary with debug symbols than it does to read the code and find the bug by manual inspection

Valgrind failing with "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value", but only when compiled with optimizations and with clang (doesn't fail with gcc). UBSAN is clean. Where do you think the problem is?

I have been informed UBSAN is a red herring; it tests different things than MSAN

I'm happy to see clang moving up the polls, the fact that it is sensitive to optimizations, compiler version and compiler choice makes it feel like a clang-9 miscompilation to me...

@typesanitizer I have minimized the repro sufficiently that I feel confident calling it a clang bug. Time to turn off valgrind on this clang version lol

A sanitizer (e.g. ASAN/UBSAN/MSAN) passes on -O0 and fails on -O2. How likely is the problem to be a compiler bug versus user code error?

@tenderizacion This is a nice paper! I will ask, though, if the fact that it was a sanitizer that changed differentially (and not the output of the program) changes things

I wasted a day on unsigned overflow in: for (int64_t x = vec.size() - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--). What lint/sanitizer would you expect to catch this?

@fiigii In fact, originally the code was int64_t x = dim() - 1 where dim returned an int64_t, but the refactor involved inlining the method so it could be moved to a function...
