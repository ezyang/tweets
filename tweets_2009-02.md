@gsnedders There should be no problem; indeed, I believe those rules are meant to deal specifically with this sort of case.

@gsnedders Yes, but Sivonen is not uses the PHP DOM extension, which enforces the bad checks. I suppose for certain cases DOM should be ok.

@futurecat Re HTML Purifier: What's up?

@futurecat Hmm... Lexer was the very first piece of code I wrote for HTML Purifier, so it's not surprising, although it should be fixed.

@futurecat Heh. __toString is one of the things we avoid since it's not uniformly supported in PHP5, but for debugging I guess it's ok.

@futurecat What kind of information would you be looking for?

Completely stuffed. Apparently, eating slowly over long periods of time = more overeating.

I find it amusing that PHP 5.0.0 - 5.0.3 don't even compile on my machine.

@pda 4.0.0 will have everything we ever wanted in HTML Purifier. Plus a pony. (We're not sure at this point :-)

@zgordon Be careful though, that you are still using an HTML filter of some sort; otherwise that could be a security vuln.

@zgordon Sounds like you have magic quotes on.

@examancer I've used HTML Purifier! (In fact, I wrote it). Do you have any specific concerns?

@nickashley Using HTML means that you can use a WYSIWYG editor, which is arguably more friendly. BBcode is a de-factor standard though.

@TimFletcher Markdown or FCK Editor, you still need to run the resulting HTML through a filter (Markdown does not enforce security)

@nickashley Trying to do WYSIWYG without HTML is not pleasant.

"PHP is used only for running HTML Purifier". This makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. :-) http://tinyurl.com/dmzwep

@gsnedders To be honest, though, I can think of some instances (XInclude) when doing this would be useful

@gsnedders Unfortunately, no. If you hack something so that it passes an HTMLElement straight to DOMLexer, that would be awesome!
