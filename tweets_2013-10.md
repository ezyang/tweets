"Another common misconception is to link exceptions erroneously with fluid binding." (PFPL, pg. 275) I wonder what Harper means here.

@pkhuong ...if a handler is not resolved according to dynamic scope, how is it resolved?

@pkhuong Well, that's an encapsulation style concern; morally, one can think of handlers as rethrowing if they're not allowed to touch it

It really pays to be really, really explicit about syntax in teaching; probably the number one "trivial thing" that isn't actually trivial

@simrob Yes, syntax cognitive overload is a big problem. But I don't know how to overcome it, besides practice.

@existentialtype @pkhuong I looked at both sections and didn't see anything directly addressing the issue; do you have a pgno?

@chrisamaphone there's also the |-o, which I only learned recently, which means "stopping"

@ffee_machine @chrisamaphone I can't ascii, but the left one is the hand is going down

Why a chemical hazard sign? Why because of liquid nitrogen, of course! ![](media/391688468268474368-BW-OliDCMAAhbRQ.jpg)

@psygnisfive Yes, it's great! And way easier to make than normal ice cream.

I am lecturing about modularity and want to talk about ML modules. But this is not my home turf; what is a good resource to use?

@zauspar Also, disjoint-set is a pretty common data structure when dealing with equivalence classes

@krismicinski Great! I think proof-by-pointing with induction is still open; Bertot '94 mentions the basic difficulty

Workaround for broken Apple Preview on Xournal exported PDFs: use a Type 1 font

What are your Type 1 fonts? Try running `fc-list | grep pfb | cut -d: -f2 | sort | uniq`
