Had an interesting discussion with @gilbazoid about the nature and desirability of coercion in a classroom setting.

@sixolet @gilbazoid Theory of education (though the class we are teaching is a programming languages class). I feel frightfully unread here.

Guys, concurrency is hard. (No, not to program; rather, to lecture about!)

@ccshan It's not the best, but when it comes to notation I tend to tell people what it means, and hope for the best. It doesn't always work.

They tell writers to "kill your darlings." This advice applies to coders too.

RT @krisajenkins: @ezyang @lexicallyscoped I'm married to a writer, and I find they're surprisingly similar disciplines, once you get past â€¦

@yminsky Just aging in the young generation (keep things in the nursery for two rounds before promoting) and immutability.

@yminsky We in fact have a lovely wikipage on the topic: https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Commentary/Rts/Storage/GC/Aging (block structured heap helps)

@yminsky Heap is divided into 4k blocks, each block has metadata recording generation and age. No pointer tagging needed!

@yminsky Yes, one per generation. Fractions done using a trick: the nursery is one block set, but blocks are also marked with "destination"

@yminsky Fresh blocks have dest = nursery, but after GC the remaining nursery blocks get dest = next generation. GC uses dest for copying.

@yminsky I don't think we've done numbers with fractions, at least, there's nothing mentioned in the commit log. I think aging is worth it

@yminsky Nope, nothing yet.
