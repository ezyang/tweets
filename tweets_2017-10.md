@evanborden @cdparx I think it is doable, and I think it would be useful!

@acfoltzer @stdlib Intern code: the gift that keeps giving :) (Though, I though y'all rewrote big chunks of it after I left haha)

@jfischoff Well, I may be a bit biased, but if you just want to tinker, I think PyTorch is a pretty good choice. Depends on what you want to do.

You are writing a PL with simple dynamic semantics, but are not sure what the type system should be. Should you make the tc pluggable?

@flippac It's first-order and pure, but all proposals for type systems on it are "complicated" (think intersection types with bounded polymorphism)

What's the difference between "a PL with a type system" and "a PL with a static analysis." What if they both live in the compiler.

@neurocy I like this response. But surely one can have "stuck" terms regardless of whether or not one has a type system or not?

@flippac Right. So you'd have to have some sort of extensible syntax. Which isn't the worst thing in the world...

@jakzale Many static analyses are global, but they don't have to be.

Maybe what I am wondering is, if your language is simple enough, can it have multiple "type systems"? What if some of these live externally?

@stdlib The way NVIDIA does this for their docs also drives me crazy
