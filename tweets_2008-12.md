@jabcreations I'm under the impression that the Web Accessibility Guidelines are inherently not-machine-fixable. Hm?

@jabcreations I wonder if we're talking about the same thing?

@mattfarina I second JAAulde's suggestion! (of course, I'm slightly partial for this case :-)

The score... Edward: 425, HTML5: 739 + 8 infinite loops.

@gsnedders Do I care enough about Git to keep it out of html5lib? Not sure. But commit access to update/fix tests would be nice :-)
