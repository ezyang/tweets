That feeling when you spent the afternoon minimizing the bug, but then that other senior engineer figures it out reading the code (but seriously, awesome work by malfet. Context: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/36098)

Apparently compilers are allowed by the standard to optimize away repeated loads of an atomic? That's fucking nuts!

Is it OK to join a thread in the destructor of an object with static storage destruction or is this not permitted by the C++ standard? (Is this question even well defined?)

@pkhuong But suppose you do it all right and you have no dependencies on other static data that may have been destructed before destruction gets to you. Is it valid to join a thread in a destructor for static data?

@pkhuong OK, but surely you're not going to tell me that it's impermissible to deallocate heap allocated data inside destructors of static lifetime objects?

As a power user, can some one explain to me how the fuck I'm supposed to use the new GitHub notifications interface? As far as I can tell it takes so many more clicks/keystrokes to process notifications than the previous interface.

@acid2 @angerman_io Yeah, I can kind of see how some people would like the new interface. I just don't understand how I (personally) am supposed to use it. I typically respond to &gt;50% of my notifications. Maybe I'm weird.
