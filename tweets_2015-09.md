If you have a language for it, you can play with it. And if you can play with it, you can invent. -- Mary Sheeran #icfp15

Who said that you can't have a strict language inside a lazy language? Nonsense.  https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/UnliftedDataTypes

@jacobmcarthur Well, they are not strictness, but given the properties of an unlifted type, functions which operate over them must be strict

@jacobmcarthur It certainly is a bit spooky, but the point is that you can /already/ do this in Haskell today!

@mgrnbrg @skilpat This is an oddity of undefined: undefined is kind polymorphic so it can be used in kind Unlifted. But it just errors now!

@mgrnbrg @skilpat I think this is what you want! But we do need a 'suspend' special form which doesn't force.

@mgrnbrg @skilpat A horrible horrible hack! Subkinding. (Or levity polymorphism, after Richard gets his hands on it.)

@freebroccolo Do we have sheaf semantics for System FÏ‰? (If so, does F-ing modules answer the question then?)
