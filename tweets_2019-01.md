Working on autocomplete for PyTorch. The good UX approach requires maintaining a duplicate file of type annotations; the DRY approach causes an ugly internal module to show up in the autocomplete module list. Which do you prefer?

@pycharm @lesniewski When I write a type stub for public_mod that does `from ugly_internal_module import *`, autocomplete for those identifiers reports the module as ugly_internal_module rather than public_mod. Details: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/12500#issuecomment-456649573
