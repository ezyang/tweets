T/F: if you want to write fast code, write down a list of what morally should happen, and then make sure the actual code only does that

@sigkill_dk But even in this domain, the way to write fast kernels is to figure how fast you can morally go (roofline model) and hold yourself to it

You want to write the loop `for (int i = base; i &lt; bound; i += block)` but bound may be close to MAX_INT. How do you write this without overflow?

@cbarrett This would not work if `bound == MAX_INT`

@cbarrett Hmm, actually, maybe it would, but only because I said `i &lt; bound` and not `i &lt;= bound`

@cbarrett Though requiring the assembly be the same in both cases might be unrealistic...

Is there a way to tell a C/C++ optimizer "assume X is true for the body of this code", without having it actually generate code to test X is true

RT @shachaf: @ezyang It depends on X, but you can often use something like "if (!X) unreachable();".

Hi Twitter-sphere. Have you ever setup recurring cachegrind profiling for a program you worked on? Can you share the setup? https://www.sqlite.org/cpu.html is the only setup I'm aware of (one interesting thing: they have some TCL scripts for processing cachegrind outputs)

When changing the semantics of code, turn what would be runtime errors into compile time errors through whatever means necessary.
