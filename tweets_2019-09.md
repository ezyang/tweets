So... most of the slowdown for non-POD thread_local in -fPIC libraries is _tls_getaddr(), not the POD wrapper, right?

@pkhuong initial-exec: the tragedy of the commons in TLS (fortunately most libraries don't know what this is heh heh)

Great blog post by @cwillycs about contributing to PyTorch for the very first time. Best quote: “I don’t have a PhD in ML… I can’t do this.” Ssshh, of course you can. https://medium.com/@cwillycs/committing-to-pytorch-by-someone-who-doesnt-know-a-ton-about-pytorch-fa222253cf2d

@rickasaurus Sometimes you just need some global reasoning on programs; modularity won’t cut it!

@jfischoff @deech https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/commentary/compiler/recompilation-avoidance It only applies inside a package; external to a package the tracking is a lot more coarse.

So, when I was at MIT, there was this joke list of fake Unicode characters, and there was one that was "NEGROPONTE BOONDOGGLE" and I cannot find it any more; am I hallucinating?

There's an oboe shop that I have visited a few times in my dreams. There's a square room and a stair right behind the counter. It's always weirdly busy, and no, they never have Loree tubes in stock.
