@0nifr We are thinking about adding forward AD to PyTorch. We’d like to do this without having to redo all of our derivative formulas. Transposition of functions is the key to unlock the door to a secret paradise...

Reverse mode automatic differentiation is just the transpose of the linear approximation of a function at some point, what’s the problem?

@shachaf That’s the transpose! If A -&gt; B is your linear approximation, the RAD is the transposed linear map, B -&gt; A (At this point a mathematician breaks down my door and says, “No no no, that’s in the duuuual space sir!”)

@shachaf @sigkill_dk I doubt you would say that the linear map A -&gt; B is the same thing as the linear map B -&gt; A? We can talk about the domain and range of a linear map without referring to computational concerns

@shachaf This is what the Wikipedia article says but it’s very misleading because at the end of the day you want to take a vector product with the Jacobian. And in forward mode it’s a jvp, but in backwards it’s a vjp, and if you consider the linear map on v it transposes.

@shachaf @sigkill_dk I mean sure, there’s a dual space involved, but most practitioners don’t consider it at all. We don’t pass around nx1 column tensors, after all

@PerryWagle Mm, I don't think so. When I say dual is "half CPS", it's because you have to dualize a type twice to get the CPS form (A -&gt; R) -&gt; R

@krismicinski In linear algebra, the transpose of a linear map A -&gt; B, is the induced map (B -&gt; R) -&gt; (A -&gt; R) (A -&gt; R being the dual space of A). I think of CPS as taking A to (A -&gt; R) -&gt; R, thus "half" a CPS (come to think of it, we call A -&gt; R the dual functor in Haskell too)

@Deran44525300 The major components are: (1) you need to know how to write fast CPU/CUDA kernels for operations, (2) you need to design your tensor data structure, (3) for an eager mode framework, you need to implement automatic differentiation. http://blog.ezyang.com/2019/05/pytorch-internals/ might be helpful
