Started thinking about why type class constraints can't be solved with Datalog: damn those pesky type constructors!

@admitscut @simrob Not sure; context is colleague wanted to know if he could have negative type class constraints

@DavidJRHarrison @admitscut @simrob You could proceed constructively but I'm pretty sure he wants LEM.

@freebroccolo @admitscut @simrob In fact it is! I wonder how you guessed? https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0019-opt-in-builtin-traits.md

@hermanradtke @ReinH @freebroccolo @bascule It can hardly be called an RTS. Just a single memory management function https://github.com/ezyang/ghc-rts-rust/blob/master/BlockAlloc.rs

When you have definitions, PL is nice at telling you how to prove them. But it does less well when you don't have a definition at all

RT @krismicinski: @ezyang what is PL in this context? A proxy for "formal reasoning about inductively defined objects and their proofs?"

@krismicinski Could be. (But of course, then someone will say, "There's more to PL than that!")

@krismicinski Maybe take some art classes: still life and portrait as a teenager helped me a lot with proportions and art-sense.
