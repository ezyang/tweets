No Backpack today, there was some last minute (justified) CR on the Cabal patches. Maybe tomorrow!

Backpack syntax: (1) attoparsec (Atto as Atto.BS) requires (Str as Str.BS) v. (2) attoparsec (Str as Str.BS) =&gt; (Atto as Atto.BS)

@PLT_cheater attoparsec is a pkg which takes in as input Str and produces Atto; plz wire Str w Str.BS and bring into scope Atto.BS

@PLT_cheater Atto (Str.BS as Str) doesn't work, because (Str.BS as Str) applies to attoparsec as a whole

@PLT_cheater Can have attoparsec (Atto as Atto.BS, Atto.Sub as http://Atto.Sub.BS) requires (Str as Str.BS, Builder as Builder.BS)
