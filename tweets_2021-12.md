@austinvhuang @christopherdone IMO, there are situations where the best memory management pattern for some pattern is just GC. Whether or not that means you should just not write Rust is unclear, but globally it‚Äôs a tool I want to be able to have

You know how libraries like numpy let you use interpreted languages but run fast because you have compiled implementations of the data structures and kernels I wonder if you can do the same thing with general purpose data structures (like a NoSQL database but more about compute?)

@alcides Maybe that is the point: to do general computation need an expressive language (numba, SQL) and not just a few library calls (numpy), therefore the task is impossible. But maybe you don‚Äôt need a full sublanguage? (SQL)

@MDavidHansen @alcides @JuliaLanguage I think the hesitation here is Numpy/SQL are portable in some sense; you could (hypothetically, in the case if Numpy) use them from whatever interpreted language you like, and maybe you have other reasons to prefer one over another. Modularity to ease adoption

You want to stop solo maintaining an OSS project which others refer to by name. What should happen to the name when you are done? Should you keep the name and encourage forks to find a new name, or roll the dice on a new maintainer (suppose there is no obvious choice)?
