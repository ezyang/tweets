One of the troubles with defining types is that there is no way to easily switch between precision; e.g., you could do Tensor, FloatTensor, Tensor[2, 4, 5, 6], but these are all noncompositional different choices. Refinement types help; are there other techniques?

@samth hypothesis seems to make it hard to force people to do this. It also introduces other forms of flakiness, e.g., as timing deadlines. I think if you spent enough time configuring it you could get it to work, but no one on that team has the interest. So it ded.

@jaredweakly @sigkill_dk I'm not too qualified to generalize here, but my general observation is that lock free algorithms rely a lot on the indirection afforded by pointers. You can have a reader chase a pointer and continue to work with the result while you shunt the pointer to go somewhere else.
