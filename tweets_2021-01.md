You hold a contest where you ask participants to flip a fair coin N times, and whoever has the most heads in a row wins. How would you detect cheaters?

You may specify what RNG should be used, but the seed is not known to you and the contestant gets to actually do the flips

@codydroux If someone submitted a transcript where all their flips were heads you'd know they were cheating. You can determine, in aggregate, roughly how much cheating across all contestants is going on. What else can you do?

@ShriramKMurthi @TaliaRinger @djg98115 One of the defining moments of my PhD career was when I had a honest conversation at a conference with Norman Ramsey about what realistically I would have to do to get to an R1 university.

@cHHillee You'd have to do it a little differently. Maybe something like, prior to the contest you know the general theme (e.g., it will be a sudoku style puzzle) and can prep code for it, then during the contest you get a variation (e.g., https://perpendicular.institute/puzzle/fun-with-sudoku/) and have to adapt

@cHHillee In school, we teach all about procedural and object-oriented abstraction, but a lot of software engineering is about making sure code can be *edited* to account for new use cases (and this is rarely taught).

@shachaf Suppose I have a multilinear function A x B -&gt; C. I should be able to transpose it to functions like A x C -&gt; B and B x C -&gt; A.

@shachaf So say the function in question is matrix multiply. By following types, if you have f : IxJ -&gt; JxK -&gt; IxK. Then you also have f_B : IxJ -&gt; IxK -&gt; JxK defined as f_B(A,C) = A^T @ C, and f_A : JxK -&gt; IxK -&gt; IxJ as f_A(B,C) = C @ B^T

@shachaf But I figured that out using the types. There's supposed to be a purely calculational way to get there (the same way it's super easy to transpose a matrix) but that's the part breaking my brain
