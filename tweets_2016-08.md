@Blaisorblade @a_cowley Also, git signs commits, not tags. This really surprised me when I learned it!

@Blaisorblade @lexi_lambda @skilpat Private deps orthogonal to Backpack. I heard there are tech difficulties supporting them in solver.

These days, I get annoyed when people don't tell me to RTFM, because that means the knowledge isn't recorded anywhere durable.
