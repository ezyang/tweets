I don't understand how anyone writes robust async JavaScript, even with all of the new features. Too easy to accidentally forget an await.

@jomsdev The trouble is forgetting an await results in nondeterministic bugs, where most of the time, the timing works out "just right" and it works OK (until it doesn't)

@alexeyraga I find it amusing to see this juxtaposed with TC concluding that they will not advocate for a programming style that can only be done safely with linting (re ASI)

cmake install(DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR} ...) is an antipattern; it will pick up your build directory and all sorts of other goo. Use a file(GLOB ...) and install(FILE ...) instead.
