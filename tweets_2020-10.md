It's like PATTERN MATCHING but for C++ FUNCTION OVERLOADS

@the_antlr_guy It's really weird that Python doesn't just natively have subexpression level granularity in backtraces (and that, as far as I can tell, no one has complained about it either!)

@sigkill_dk Hmm... forcing 64bit doesnâ€™t seem like a good call, speaking with my DL framework maintainer hat on. It is a really big difference on CUDA, so much so that we will ship two copies of a kernel to get the 32bit speedup.

@sigkill_dk Yep, for the index arithmetic. You don't do the stride computation on the pointers, after all.

@sigkill_dk Ah OK, in that case I misread! Array size as 64-bit is very reasonable, and we do it that way too :)

When I interview, I do a "index-y" question and a "recursion-y" question. One of the oddest things is often people who perform well on one question do poorly on the other (in both directions!)

@arntzenius Yes. Another way to get here intuitively is "dual" is "transpose" and transposition rules (AB)^T = B^T A^T aka the same "reverse" action

@nelhage I would add that deterministic measurements (e.g. instruction counts) are a superpower for understanding small changes in perf; otherwise you can't measure them at all!

@nelhage Block arguments are more administratively complicated as you now have multiple "functions" not just one big function with weird phi nodes. Smh people care shruuuug

@nelhage Exactly. If you are a rabid functional programmer, you already spent a lot of time making your compiler work well with functions, but otherwise...

@nelhage Well, if it were me, Iâ€™d just make it not an assert error to have phi nodes referencing dead blocks. Whereas caller/callee mismatch is defo bad.

Trying to solve some logic puzzles with z3 and god some of these constraints I have no idea how to code (in this case, numbers on grid must form connected lines in ascending order, forming N regions covering field)

@spmlambda In this case, I know there isn't a preexisting solver, because it's a mash up of two logic puzzle types. (PM if you want to know the problem; it's from an active puzzle hunt so I don't want to share it publicly yet)
