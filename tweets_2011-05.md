I can't believe I discovered functional dependencies in Haskell before in databases.

@fmapE Bell ringing. More specifically, I do change ringing, which is a British style of bell ringing based on permutations.

Here's an evil idea: since Haskell doesn't have module polymorphism, hack it with pre-processor includes. Mm!

@ccshan Good question! My feeling is that as long as humans are communicating with humans, that won't be the case. But I could be wrong.

@michaelschade Cool! Note that not all numeric code falls out this nicely; this particularly algorithm happened to work out well :-)

@michaelschade Yes. Also, if the algorithm relies heavily on mutation, keeping track of all of the changing variables is a pain.

@sigfpe It's always seemed to me that which induction is being used is clear from context. I'm curious what prompted the comment.

@sigfpe Well since you usually need an axiom *of* induction... But yeah, most mathematicians don't think much about foundations.
