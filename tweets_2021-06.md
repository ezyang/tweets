@xnningxie Was reading Perceus paper, very nice work! Naively, it seems that Perceus gives up borrowing (e.g., (f x) (g x), f call conventionally borrows x to avoid dup). Is the claim that as long as f doesn't use x in an owning way, dup-drop fusion will fire?

But borrow calling convention is a bit different from owning calling convention, so you'd have to get f inlined for this to work. Not so easy to do? https://gist.github.com/ezyang/05dd9fad13cc42fab4d3be299aafb059 (but maybe the core here is pre optimization?)

Not just for engineering, for example this role https://www.facebook.com/careers/v2/jobs/1291391224610656/ is for AI/ML developer advocate (primarily around engaging with user base)

@_dsevero There's no remote in Brazil alas, and I think Facebook only has a sales office there.

well f. Windows is requiring BitLocker recovery key, had to unfreeze my OneDrive account, and now there's a key, right date AND ITS FOR THE WRONG DEVICE

I'm pretty this is because I immediately reinstalled Windows the day after I got the device to get dual boot going and asdfjkl I can't believe it just lost the recovery key entirely

@webyrd Touhou is actually pretty OK, since most of the groups are popular enough that their stuff gets uploaded to YouTube. But the more obscure stuff......
