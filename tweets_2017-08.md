@Blaisorblade @Profpatsch @chris__martin It's fair :) Although Backpack is even more wordy than ML modules (ha!) so you might not want to use it for your Maps and Sets (classics!)

@evanborden OK, now I remember why: we never implemented compaction on functions, since free variables are a bit tricky to grab. Possible in principle.

@evanborden Probably. If you have a source build of GHC handy you can check pretty easily. Maybe FUN_STATIC automatically works!
