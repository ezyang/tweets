@gcouprie @Blaisorblade Still a little confused. When I wrote HTML parsers, I usually had to call strpos before indexing

@sigfpe @kolmodin @MatthewMarkland They're not really ASTs... more like program traces (because that's just what happens when you have an automatic differentiation system)

@sigfpe @kolmodin @MatthewMarkland Yep, talking about PyTorch. TF is AST building all the way.

@jcreed @chrisamaphone Tactics aren't part of the TCB in Coq, you always get proof terms in the end. Sometimes, you even get to "No goals left" but then Coq rejects your term at final typechecking when you try to Qed. ;)

@acid2 When this happened to me (not drop of water, but finger touch) it was because of a short due to an incorrectly grounded screen. Maybe try to fix the wiring?
