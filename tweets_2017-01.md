@BrandonBloom It is a good idea if we only care about internal deps! But I feel like multiple libs per pkg is a painpoint to design for...

@BrandonBloom That's easy: internal libs can have differing external deps. So if everything depends on everything, may pull in unneeded libs

@BrandonBloom Suppose you have multiple exes and want an internal lib for cli handling, which depends on external cli package

@BrandonBloom You also have a public library, shouldn't have dep on cli lib. Need declared internal deps to insure this is case

@BrandonBloom I don't completely understand your point, maybe I can clarify more. Internal/external has to do with unit of code/distribution

@BrandonBloom A package has version, you distribute it. A library is some code, needs some deps.

@BrandonBloom You might want to release multiple libs in lockstep, but user might not want to build all libs in package.

@BrandonBloom Maybe one lib needs OpenGL, but that is too annoying to build for many users. They'd still like to use yoir package!

@BrandonBloom Why not force every lib to write all external pkgs they transitively depend on? It can be repetitive!

@BrandonBloom Maybe you are saying, versions should be assigned to the smallest unit of code possible?

Perhaps the moral of mix-in linking is that your subtyping order should also have a least upper bound.

Under what circumstances would you describe something as a "semantic object"? What does "syntactic semantic object" mean to you?
