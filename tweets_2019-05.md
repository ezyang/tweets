@anoncept To me, modern-ness implies that the syntax is up-to-date with the times, there are affordances for usability, and that it is being maintained.

How exceptionally odd. After rebooting, I have to open Xournal three times before pen+eraser works (first start, nothing works; second start, pen only; third start, everything's OK.)

That feeling when you write some code and think, "Hmm, should I optimize X? Nah, I should wait to find out if it matters"... and then you find out it does matter!
