PL theory inference rules are sometimes too declarative, can mask the underlying algorithmic content. Don't know of a more standard notation

@avibryant @sritchie Too difficult to discover dependencies and block. Many compilers will need more control, e.g. buildsome

@matthieubulte Many things one wants to do with inference rules, reasoning is just one; implementation and understanding are others

@rob_rix I definitely hate it when papers drop code on me for their algorithm.

For those fretting about micropackages: could it be that you want microcomponents (modularity) in a single package (distribution)?

@sclv I don't think so, components also need handling for namespacing

@ongardie That article is nonsense, dead code elimination applied at the module level would have the same effect.
