The edge case here is regarding precision of inputs. The dumb implementation is if you want to add two halfs, you just have a function (half, half) -&gt; half. But not if one argument or another is a scalar; then you want to handle (half, float) -&gt; half and (float, half) -&gt; half

Technically, this is somewhat error prone, because to get the IR small you need to optimize both src and tgt programs, and there's a chance that LLVM will resolve nondeterminism differently, but in practice this doesn't seem to happen?
