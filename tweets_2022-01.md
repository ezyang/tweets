@bubblingbeebles Can u do it optimally 👹

@bubblingbeebles Dynamic programming solves it in principle but with a state space of at least 2^26 you gonna have a bad time

@bubblingbeebles Greedy optimality might be easier, simply choose the word that maximally reduces entropy no matter what the true word is. This is some gigantic probability expression but it’s probably just quadratic or something

@bppcomplete @bubblingbeebles Ok 2^26 is a wild underestimate. The DP table needs to correspond to the game state that effects what words are valid where.

@bppcomplete @bubblingbeebles An extremely bad game state would be “which words in dictionary are still possible”. This directly gives entropy but requires 2^(dict size) states

----
@bppcomplete @bubblingbeebles An approximate game state is the coloring of letters. Four colors (unknown, grey, yellow, green) so 4^(alphabet = 26) but this doesn’t account for positional knowledge on the table so it is not optimal. I agree this variant is feasible.

----
@bppcomplete @bubblingbeebles An exact but still naive state is to track the set of possible letters at each square. (2^26)^5. This is too big and it also ignores compression when letters are dead

@NicholasLYang I took some classes in the Dept of History and Philosophy of Science and I really liked the format and wished there was a version for CS, but to do it properly you have to treat it as primarily a history/philosophy course (so, e.g., your HWs are all essays)

If you're curious about what NYU students thought about the class, there are some discussions about it which you can find here: https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Fnyu+edward+yang&rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS920US920&ei=auzgYaqpB8yt0PEPo5Sz0AQ&ved=0ahUKEwiqhpn7pLD1AhXMFjQIHSPKDEoQ4dUDCA4&uact=5&oq=site%3Areddit.com%2Fr%2Fnyu+edward+yang&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EANKBAhBGAFKBAhGGABQWFiYDWCODmgBcAB4AYABlAKIAcQOkgEFMS42LjSYAQCgAQHAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz

The labs in the class are pretty interesting and I'll try to figure out a way to publish them for external folks who are following the class. No grading support though: you're on your own ;)
