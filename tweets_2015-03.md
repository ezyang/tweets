@d_christiansen Hey, did Michael Adams and co. correspond with you when they were working on indentation-sensitive parsing?

@d_christiansen Is Idris eventually planning to use their parser? What is blocking on the way?

RT @d_christiansen: @edwinbrady @ezyang Probably the biggest reason we don't have their stuff, tbh, is that it comes as tarballs in emails …

@d_christiansen @edwinbrady Oof, that sucks. But I guess it's good to hear that it's engineering and not because their parser is slow

@d_christiansen When I get a tarball, the first thing I do is turn it into a Git branch. Helps a lot, but you gotta know the base rev. :)

@skilpat Another example of awkwardness is simulating type classes with Backpack; types defined in modules have different names, no renaming

@skilpat By the way, for small-scale SMD it probably makes sense to distinguish between "global" and "local" module names.

@skilpat I came to the same conclusion last night in the shower :) But impl-wise it's annoying if application can occur inside import lists

@skilpat Honestly, though, I think the inability to rename types when instantiating modules is a bigger problem (this is workaroundable)

@skilpat More like, if I want to define an Ord :: [ data T; cmp :: T -&gt; T -&gt; Ordering ], I can't set T = Int/Bool/whatever directly
