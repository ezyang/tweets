Git rebases are easier for developers to use, but they throw away history.  Is there a way to get the best of both worlds: can an arbitrary (interactive) rebase be written as a series of merges? (1/6)

If this were possible, one could imagine an alternative frontend for looking at merges which *hides* merge history (and presents the simplified "rebased history) when it is not desired. (2/6)

An easy example: rebasing a stack of commits onto a newer base corresponds exactly to successively merging each individual commit into the newest HEAD.  (3/6)

----
Not everything is easy.  Consider a commit on base A; if you rebase (cherry-pick) it onto an earlier base B, a subsequent 'git merge A' will recover the commits in A that you had "removed" when you did a rebase. (4/6)

(Originally on Twitter: [Sun Sep 16 22:40:31 +0000 2018](https://twitter.com/ezyang/status/1041456825521135616))
----
If you replace this with a merge into base B, A is *still* an ancestor of your commit (it wasn't an ancestor of the rebased commit), and Git will say that 'git merge A' is a no-op. (5/6)

So, for such a scheme to work, we need a way of "hiding" parents from merge-base calculation.  Is there any VCS that supports this?  Could Git be convinced to add this? Thanks for reading. (6/6)

@yminsky Yeah, this is how we do it at Facebook. Phabricator has a metadata overlay for tracking versions of diffs as they're under development, but it all goes away when you actually land.

@yminsky Right. We don't "throw" it away, but it's certainly not accessible from hg; you have to go to some other store to get it.

@johnregehr @samth At least in GHC Haskell, you can use unsafeCoerce# to manufacture a new pointer, but you basically have to understand all of the internal implementation details to do this safety.
