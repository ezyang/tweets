Strangely enough, it would seem -fdefer-type-errors is most useful when you don't actually intend on running the code

@nomeata Never published. I suppose a web link will have to suffice.

Does anyone have an English language reference for Huet's thesis? (In particular I want the unification algo for infinite regular trees)

Apparently, to do unification on infinite regular trees... you just skip the occurs check

@ashok_menon Nice! What bits are you planning to translate?

"Applicative semantics is safe when used with pure modules. It is suited to Haskell, which isolates effects monadically." Uh, no.

@npouillard Module purity ~= need to run code to get the module? Java classes (minus initializers) would be pure in this sense, no monads!

TIL that functor application in OCaml is a runtime operation.

@jonsterling Well, I always thought OCaml had some defunctorization pass.

@npouillard Yes, it has the right idea but misuses "monadic effects"

Badmouth cabal-install all you want, but the modular dependency solver is pretty cool.
