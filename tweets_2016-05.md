@flippac I'm in a very simple setting, proving the substitution lemma for System F. TAPL proofs are on derivation but it seems unnecessary.

@eisaru @flippac It is certainly true that you then have to invert. But is this inversion always possible? (Humans "do it automatically"!)

Thought: Template Haskell and imports can compromise: must explicitly import modules, but can TH program what is in scope. Interesting?

Dependency solving is just a program synthesis problem.

@krismicinski @yminsky Maybe not first order but in practice variational, which could make it interesting again.

@rob_rix Many things cannot be (easily?) understood as synthesis problems. What is synthesized when you typecheck?

@krismicinski Seem to be complementary? Synthesis type and specification directed, solver are constraint directed.

@krismicinski I think its fair to say that dependency solving as practiced today is not synthesis. But why couldn't it be?

Index is partial on finite lists but total on streams. Map is same for both. Maybe want co/data polymorphism?

@ndm_haskell @github Thanks for reporting a GHC bug. Its too bad there aren't obvious fixes for the problem.

But, I suppose, one could argue infinite streams should not have a Nil constructor at all.

@CoBuddha IMO its the variance rathole. Easy to go undecidable. C.f. Java wildcards.

@ndm_haskell We should lobby a bit harder on the GHC ticket then. That sounds good to me (even better if we still had the old checker)

@cbarrett @flippac Least fixed point for F(X) = X * Int (IntStream) has no inhabitants; that's why streams are only useful as codata.

Should package managers know about the type structure of their PL? I used to think no but now I am not sure.

@awesomeintheory According to the PVP you have to bump major versions whenever you make a BC breaking change... Hard to see how to get there

@yminsky Yep, enforcing semver is a clear use. Another less obvious one is letting the pkgman centrally plan your type class instances

@yminsky One clear downside for Elm: package manager depends on compiler; thus can't have one pkgman for multiple compiler versions
