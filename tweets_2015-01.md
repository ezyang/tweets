Do you know of any literature describing garbage collected heaps with regions that are GC'd differently (e.g. no outbound pointers)

@mrb_bk Right, generational GC is the most influential idea in this space. I'm looking for more extreme applications of the principle.

@eikke Erlang has per-process heap, transfer between heaps; this is another common point in the design space.

@nokusu @eikke No pointers between process heaps also means no direct access. Sometimes still want something that looks like single heap.

@MosRobinson Note that the translation can result in exponential blowup, so "minimal" is only in the eyes of the DFA.
