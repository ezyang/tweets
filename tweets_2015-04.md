So... is the moral of F-ing modules, "syntax is hard, let's do semantics"?!

@chrisamaphone Avoiding the avoidance problem, use of elaboration static semantics, how everyone else was trying to give syntactic rules...

@chrisamaphone I've been thinking about MixML recently, which only has elaboration. The theme is not trying to explain syntax directly...

@samth Sorry, I would agree that's the first order moral; I guess this is something of a second-order moral, if that makes sense?

RT @samth: @ezyang No, that seems totally off. Moral is: you don't need dependent types/translucent sums/etc.

@samth "Why did it take so long to figure out F-ing modules"? Maybe everyone defined the statics directly, and fell into dependent types?

@samth Elaboration means they lose "fully syntactic" signatures. Says something about syntax?

@samth Yes, I suppose this argument only has weight if you believe elaboration is the simplest possible way to give semantics for ML mods

@jonsterling Generativity means side-effects, which makes things a bit more complicated it. We have not seriously tackled this problem.

Maybe the incremental approach to explaining things is a cop-out, because you couldn't figure out how to explain it all at once.

@ydewit If we change the top-level keyword to be signature, no reason why this couldn't be the case.

@ydewit However, with mutual recursion cases, it can be useful to have both a sig and an impl!

@ydewit When you include a package, this can cause a hole to be filled in. This never occurs for imports.
