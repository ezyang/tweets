tfw can't refactor a function to forward to another function with *args, **kwargs because it breaks inspect.signature (implicit APIs arrrrgh)

@cursecompiler Does it count if the DSL is literally SQL? Ur/Web fits the bill then.

What's the minimal amount of mathematical structure you need to define a concept of JVP and VJP on both R and C?

@MarisaVeryMoe It's not just R^2; when computing VJP you have to conjugate the vector (which is actually why I'm asking the question!) More at https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html#Complex-numbers-and-differentiation

@MarisaVeryMoe @cHHillee Yeah, so the "trash" output you get when a function is not holomorphic is you'll only get some of the derivatives (e.g., you'll get the derivative with respect to changes in the real component, but not the imaginary component).

@Raisharmashivam Hi Shivam, there's someone already looking into this issue! Maybe you'd be interested in this one? https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/33501 I'm not too familiar with development on Windows, but one possibility is to use WSL to get a Linux dev environment and develop there.
