@Blaisorblade @jonathanccast "Tracks." When you force push, all of the previous commits disappear from the PR page; so even though I would believe that GitHub keeps the info somewhere, it's no longer easily accessible

@Blaisorblade @jonathanccast Yeah. But what you can see from your linked PR, there are only actually a string of commits for the last force push. This is very problematic because maybe there were comments on specific commits from earlier force pushes!

@f_aezs @MarisaVeryMoe The most compelling use case has always been for targeting graph-mode only backends via the eager API (without forcing something like TorchScript)

@HeinrichKuttler @f_aezs @MarisaVeryMoe It's a very limited form of laziness (prior to CUDA graphs becoming a thing), since you immediately queue the kernels on the stream, instead of waiting to accumulate a bunch. This is really helpful constraint, because otherwise there are too many design choices

@jimmykoppel Maybe one reason it sounds great is because there is a similar sounding variant that does work (though it might take some time): learn a component/subsystem by rewriting it with bug-for-bug parity

@jimmykoppel Pretty rarely, because it's hard to tell if you actually succeeded 100%. But I feel it's one of the big motivators behind rewrites in the large, and I've seen it a few times in super well defined cases (e.g. the program takes literally no user specified inputs)

@hillelogram It's also a sign of bad system design if you have too many questions in your binder; e.g., designing an API in C++ involves a way fatter binder of questions than designing an API in a simpler language
