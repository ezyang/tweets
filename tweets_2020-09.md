@sigfpe I would almost actually recommend people use extended generators to do effects in Python except the yield from line noise is excruciating

I find performance tuning really, really time consuming. Is this the case for people who do it all the time?

To clarify: at work I seem to mostly be dealing with "death by a thousand cuts" performance problems

@jfischoff When I'm in death by a thousand cuts land, even a microbenchmark doesn't seem to help all that much.

@vamchale This is my philosophy for debugging too: the easiest way to speed up debugging is to not make mistakes in the first place :)

@nnethercote Thanks Nicholas! Did you ever end up writing more about effectively using cachegrind and callgrind?

Callgrind has changed my life. Fuck cache simulation that's a red herring if you haven't done any profiling recently.

@trav_downs It's been a while, but I remember the push/pull model being confusing for many people, messy history, and bad separation between the main project and subprojects as problems.
