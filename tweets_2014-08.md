Hello lazywebs, are there any tools for comparing the output of Haskell profiles, e.g. with +RTS -P?

I can't believe that none of the haskell editor modes can deal with Cabal out-of-the-box

@petrillic @briantrice I'll happily take the jab, but I actually got the feeling that most pkg managers are pretty conservative ideas-wise

@petrillic @BrianTRice Well, isn't the point of decentralized systems that you don't have to globally solve the political problem? :)

@aristidb @cartazio Well, Nix is a stable distribution, but with some good design choices making it better suited for PL libs

@a_cowley @cartazio I don't think we're in disagreement, so let me know if I messed up the delivery somehow.

@a_cowley @cartazio And what makes people want to use subsets of the space of all packages? ...

@a_cowley OK, I tweaked a few things to mention it. I think of it as related to the problem of semantic versioning

@a_cowley Version requirements are unnecessary if you control all packages. It only arises when third-parties are involved

@a_cowley @cartazio Yeah, GHC 7.10 will have module renaming/thinning so you can manually resolve conflicts yourself/preemptively avoid them

@a_cowley ...and your own packages are completely isolated from the rest of the package ecosystem?

@darinmorrison It's true the decentralization problem is not PL specific! Not sure containers are always right

@psygnisfive @krismicinski @jonsterling That works less well the further away the proof system gets (e.g. linear logic)
