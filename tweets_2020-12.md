@vamchale (Disclaiming obvious conflict of interest) The evaluation setup doesn't make any sense. MKL is a CPU library, so why does its presence matter for the CUDA experiments?

@vamchale Well, typically, if you're going to compare against CUDA, you do all your compute on the GPU (so optimized CPU kernels like from MKL are irrelevant). Also, by nature of the beast, you're just going to lose at sufficiently large batch size...

@dancherp PEG can be extracted from traditional CFG (think normal imperative language IR), but they're referentially transparent!

@jimmykoppel Phi nodes are pretty hard to understand. But they are used ubiquitously. What makes theta nodes different.

@BrandonBloom @samth Yes I suppose. It's a little hard to tell what's going on with the modal type operators, is this basically a way of declaring "typed" program expression graphs that satisfy the well-formedness invariants? Is all this modal stuff because we hate graphs in FP???

@pavpanchekha Ah, the point being that you probably aren't going to have an ordering problem at all, and plain old rewriting will be just fine.

Read the λS paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08017.pdf). Clarke derivatives are cool, but as a framework implementor I'm not sure what to do with this paper

λS handles nondifferentiable functions by allowing the derivative to be a range, e.g., [0, 1] for ReLU at 0, and some other operations (e.g., integration) can get things exact again. But we don't even offer integration as a primitive in PyTorch...

The paper doesn't really set out to tell frameworks what to do: it's just an executable specification (MarshallB ftw!) Specs are great. I just I wish I knew how to implement it :)

@pkhuong Subdifferentials are the same thing as Clarke derivatives, right? In practice we just arbitrarily pick some subdifferential for the nondifferentiable points (usually one that's easy to compute) and pray

@pimiddy Monoid structure means your configuration is composable: you can assemble sub-bits and then put them together when you like.
