@khuey_ @pkhuong @cfbolz Ok I guess more accurately, Pernosco can do things like add prints and enable logging as long as it doesn't materially impact the execution of the program, which is different from hot patching a fix in gdb and then running forward to see if it worked

@pchiusano Nah, induction isn't the important distinction (Paxos is proved correct using induction). What varies is how complicated the inductive hypothesis has to be. With sorting you need only assume that the sublists are sorted; complicated IHs will have lots of extra invariants

@lindsey OOC, what convinced you to go for the VZ-R and not, e.g., the V4K (cheaper) or the VZ-X (more expensive)?

Is there such a thing as a portable power bank which also has a 3.5mm jack (or even a usb c port that can be used for extra peripherals). How am I supposed to charge a phone and use peripherals at the same time. Charging cases?

WHAT IF people front loaded the needs part of non-violent communication by having a semi-public needs list they could share with people from dramatically different backgrounds. This probably doesn't work but is a very nerdy like of thought
