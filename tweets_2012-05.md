@chrisamaphone Wordpress is pretty reasonable. I hear photographers like tumblr.

@chrisamaphone Fair enough. For me, uploading pics to Wordpress is not effortless, but I'm also speshul.

I've gotten into a bad habit of fixing type errors without actually looking at the error messages...

@chrisamaphone You could try looking at your previous stuff and calculating it from there. Or you could just put a lot of text in :-)

@chrisamaphone Re (b), do you mean, you can express module signatures with second-order logic?

@chrisamaphone Parametricity is familiar; what's behind the f-ing modules paper (besides a simple spec of a module system?)

@chrisamaphone Here's a question: do you agree with the statement, "second-order logic is strictly more powerful than OO"

@chrisamaphone As in, are there things you can encode in one that you can't in the other. But maybe that's the wrong question.

@chrisamaphone I think I'm a little confused on this point too. What does modularity mean?

@chrisamaphone Here is one possible way to do it: "Hand-wavy definitions of abstraction/modularity", "What it is in OO", "What is in logic"
