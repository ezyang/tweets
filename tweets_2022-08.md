The problem with strong Python typing is that it is essentially a different language that no one knows how to write

@RaghavMalik15 When you want strong typing (no use of Any or ignore), lots of language features become unusable because they are too fancy for mypy to understand

What's the correct name for the problem of searching for a subgraph in a directed acyclic graph. Google fu is failing me. It feels like the algorithm should be easy but there are oddly no matching SO answers, just some overly complicated papers.

My biggest problem with VSCode is I don't know what all the keyboard shortcuts are (and I suspect many of the motions I want to do, have to be customized). With traditional terminal windows + vim on the inside, I know I can do all interactions with my keyboard only.

One way to tell you're working with a really well written codebase: when things go wrong, you find there are well oiled diagnostic tools in just the right places to help you figure things out. Could be as simple as useful logging, or as complex as automated repro generation

In Python, is there a name for putting arguments in a list/box that can be cleared inside of the calling function to free it earlier than the end of the function. In C++ we would say we moved the argument into the function. Prompted by https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/83137#issuecomment-1211320670 cc @cHHillee

@yminsky Picked C++ because we could get static types, but it turns out writing an FP style compiler in C++ is awful (we ended up doing an LLVM style IR), the types aren't even that good so we ended up having to introduce dynamic types anyway for IR nodes

@yminsky Sure Python is slow and untyped, but you're not compiling *that* much stuff, and you've got mypy (though, TBF, five years ago we still supported Python 2, so the syntax for types would have been miserable). And in return you get easy debugging and no compile time

Suppose you have two floating point functions (from some deep learning application) and you want to know if they are equivalent (as far as DL is concerned--so not necessarily bitwise identical), what academic research is relevant here? (Numerical stability is the obv one)

I kind of want something like cProfile, except I only care about cumulative times, and I want timings as if I were single-stepping the code through pdb, and if some function call doesn't take enough time I don't want to trace into it

@emeryberger The typical conception of a profiler is that it collects very granular timing information all the way to the bottom of the abstraction stack (and pays overhead/sampling accordingly). But my batch program is very simple, I just want to know at a high level where I'm spending time

@emeryberger So I've got Scalene successfully running, but it looks like it might not be the right level of granularity for the problem I'm looking at right now--I'm not getting enough samples / lack of call stacks is also hurting

@emeryberger It's also possible that I just don't know how to use --profile-only correctly; I'm expecting to get samples from a particular set of modules (that are imported via importlib) but I can't get them to show up in the profile
