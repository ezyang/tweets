Functional programmer me: The fact that every vector space V is isomorphic to the dual space V -&gt; R is totally nuts. Linear algebra me: Duh man, that's totally obvious.

You're stuck solving a small optimization problem in C++ because nothing else is fast enough. You get to use one C++ library. Which one is it?

@mjsottile For the sake of argument, let's suppose that you can't reduce your problem into a well known one that there exists an explicit solver for (that's why you're writing the program in C++, rather than using bindings for a solver in your favorite language)

@kebabroyal_ Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but I feel like it's really easy to end up with some combinatorial problem where you can't use a solver on it. "Under some rules, what's the optimal sequence of actions that maximizes score within a certain amount of time"?
