Backpack design Q: suppose you import a signature which imports an orphan instance. Does this force impl to also import inst?

@light_industry At this point, I think someone should read the convo, decide what they like, and start implementing...

The interleaving of stdout/stderr should not be semantically meaningful

In expect test with munging (because the output wibbles sometimes), should you save in VCS the munged or unmunged text?

@stefan_heule I think it's the right direction? "Too hard" refers to people assigning semantic meaning to interleaving when they shouldn't

@yminsky BTW, I'm just adding expect tests to Cabal. Lots of wobbly output makes it tough. But not storing output inline with source (yet?)

@yminsky Maybe I'm misusing it. If you can "accept" output, and it is annotated with what commands generated it, is that an expect test?

@luqui You depend on multiple versions of dep; output needs to be the same no matter what version you use, even if it varies across versions

@Iceland_jack Because signatures are subtyped, it's harder to declare an invariant holds. But you can declare instances of lawful classes!
