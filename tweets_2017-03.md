@cocreature Ah, good point. Perhaps changing the title to be "Str (signature)" would be sufficient?

@DRMacIver Not stupid. The point is strict strings can't implement this function as per the spec, so they shouldn't give a "fake" impl with the type

@DRMacIver Then "matching" fails: GHC will tell you that you required somefun, but it wasn't implemented by the instantiating fails. Sig = requirements

@DRMacIver Well, the signature is a "proto-signature" that contains lots of functions, not all of which will be implemented by each module.

@DRMacIver That's right! You can always write the sig from scratch but reusing subsets is helpful.

@cocreature Hmm... for now, maybe let us rely on the writer of the signature (me in this case) putting some explanation in the module header...

@XiaogangLiu Haskell's not that great an example because ByteString returns [] (special cased, no less!) But I think people here like Text's beh better.
