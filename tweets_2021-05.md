Designing a tagged pointer field which starts uninitialized but a thread can atomically set the pointer + its thread id as tag. Setting is monotonic; reads test tag and if mismatch raise error. What memory_order do you need to read this field? (relaxed, right?)

@HeinrichKuttler @akbirkhan @korymath Holomorphic is red herring. For gradient descent you actually want the conjugate wirtinger derivative (taking advantage of real valued loss)

@HeinrichKuttler @akbirkhan @korymath @AChourdia did a pretty good job explaining it at https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/autograd.html#complex-autograd-doc (if you have suggestions for how to make the explainer clearer, let us know!)

Is there an easy to use tool I can feed bit twiddling C code to and then model check it? Like, make sure I didn't UB or anything like that.

Or like, show that it is equivalent to some simpler version of the algorithm? Or show that some properties hold? Like, this is baby Z3 stuff, I just want an easy to use UI...

@atombeast I think it's better to get the Docker image more documented, because that will have yices and z3 and all the other stuff you need (and most people will have to setup otherwise)

So @colesbury points out that a common mistake in bit twiddling code is not writing code that works across differing data type definitions (e.g., long being 32 bits on 64 bit Windows). Any tools that *also* work over this? https://twitter.com/ezyang/status/1397755948471570438

@epsilon3141 I would still say that the core of a fix can be done in an hour. Sure you might need a few more days to get all the CI ducks in a row but to get the bare bones patch out? Not much time, if you've got everything prepped.
