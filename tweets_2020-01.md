In as little time as possible, you want to extract the digits in an image like https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2019/assets/puzzles/lantern_festival/image-03.png into machine readable form. What would you do?

@tausbn I agree, as a one shot task, I'd transcribe. Now let's say you might need to do it several times, over many years. Now what would you do?

@tausbn I happen to know that at least the first result (http://ocr.space) chokes to death on this particular input image. Haven't tested the others yet.

@stephenroller I agree that the ML aspect of this is trivial, for clean images like this. So the question is more of an end-to-end one

@cartazio Yes, but then you need to ship an interpreter/compiler. Reverse mode AD is basically this.

@nelhage Well you wouldnâ€™t test something that was made impossible by types :)
