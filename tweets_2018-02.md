Aren't Ur/Web sources and signals way better than React "controlled components" and "state lifting"?

I made a thing: Convolution Visualizer https://ezyang.github.io/convolution-visualizer/index.html (basically, it's http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/conv_arithmetic.html but you can twiddle the parameters as you like)

@yminsky It's not full on SAC, but the signal monad gives me the impression you could give the recompute engine SAC like smarts

Like visualizations AND machine learning, but don't know where to start when making one? Try your hand at the starter tasks at https://github.com/ezyang/convolution-visualizer; all you need is a willingness to learn a little React.

An extremely clear articulation of how to do versioning when there is no such thing as a BC-breaking change. I wish Go luck. https://research.swtch.com/vgo

@Profpatsch Yeah, you are instead supposed to release a package with a new name when you break BC

@nbspnbsp It seems to me that the complaint about Perl was never portability, but readability.

@nbspnbsp @PLT_cheater The problem with Perl is not the symbol-soup per se, but extensive use of hidden state in common idioms. Bash has this to a degree (e.g., $?, shift) but Perl takes it to another level ($_, I'm looking at you)
