It seems difficult to write Applicative code when a Monad instance is available.

@GabrielG439 Not necessarily, ApplicativeDo won't prevent you from using liftM/&gt;&gt;/mapM/forM, all of which could be Applicative but are not.

@GabrielG439 Well, it's unclear if liftM really should have a Functor constraint? At the very least, this breaks code that says fmap = liftM

@chadaustin @yminsky This is overloading, right? In which case, what do you do when the variable in question is polymorphic?

Supposing clean slate compiler/build system (think ghc/Cabal): how would you get dep info (from inline imports) to the build system?

Very cleverly, go has said, "No way, the compiler tool should also implement the build system."

RT @EyalL: @ezyang my build system, buildsome, hooks all file system access and uses that

RT @jimduey: @ezyang Exactly. That's the way I'm doing it in @toccata_lang

@jimduey @toccata_lang Large projects often have many languages. What do you do in this case?

@EyalL If I edit the import list in a file, how do I get the updated dep graph without pre-running the compiler once?

@jimduey It's worth noticing the misery Go had integrating with Bazel https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/79

@a_cowley It's terrible, but it's actually understandable: the submodule might have local state that would be clobbered by a pull!

@a_cowley It is, but your working copy also has a copy of the files. (Note: I'm not saying Git's behavior is *good*, just understandable)

@noam_lewis @EyalL So, if I run 'ghc -c A.hs' and it tugs on B.hi, which hasn't been updated yet, does buildsome block the syscall?

@EyalL @noam_lewis OK, so I would assume no Windows support then. But that's cool!

Bazel and open source. As a compiler writer I commiserate fully. http://julipedia.meroh.net/2015/04/on-bazel-and-open-source.html

@ko_bx @a_cowley I agree. And there are many, many other very strange/terrible things with how Git handles submodules (just try rebasing!)
