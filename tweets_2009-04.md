@scottmac Yes, but not securely. Comments carry a lot of out-of-band information, so it's easy for it to be vulnerable.

RT @ivanristic http://is.gd/qmA0 which is actually DOM building masquerading as a template. XSLT acts similarly.

@ivanristic And to make their parser and the browser parser agree, you'll either have to be really strict, or reserialize the output.

@ncanderson42 I think you're pretty out of luck there. The best handwriting recognition algorithms are heavily proprietary.

@ncanderson42 Maybe we could do something convert Xournal file -&gt; picture/Evernote file and then run recognition on it

@ncanderson42 Xournal can save as PDF, which presumably can be converted to an image.

NIH is *correct* for core functionality. Anyone who says otherwise has not spent hours dealing with upstream issues. http://bit.ly/5Syz

@gsnedders In this case, core = your core business. If you're in the business of shuttling messages around, write your message queue.

The compiler apocalypse. One day, every binary compiler disappears, and we have to bootstrap ourselves from assembler again.

After having used Brief for a week, I'm not going back to Sage-Too. However, Brief does have some odd rough corners.

Ask Twitter: So how do the subscriber metrics on RSS feeds actually work? It seems to me that an accurate count ~ impossible.

@jack_daniel Agreed sentiments. Ubuntu tablet integration is no where near Windows, but Xournal does 90% of what to do with a tablet.

It is painfully obvious when you try to use software for a use-case the original authors don't use.

It's a nice, nontrivial exercise, but I think Real World Haskell introduces the Graham's scan algorithm poorly.
