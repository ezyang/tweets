@francoisfleuret @PyTorch We’ve been holding the line on “it’s spooky and dangerous” for years but it turns out six months ago we added an unrelated API (Python mode) for functorch that is general enough to implement this

You are given a legacy API to symbolically evaluate over and can either blackbox (define from scratch semantics for each operation) or whitebox (define semantics for the lang the existing implementations are written in). Which approach would you choose?

@samth The specific situation that prompted this question was CPython, where I've observed multiple cases of the blackbox approach working, where the whitebox approach was just too hard to get off the ground. Curious if this matched intuitions :)
