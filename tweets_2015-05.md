@jacobmcarthur Programs should to denote things, e.g. mathematical functions. But with fancy features like mutation, it's hard to say what.

@jacobmcarthur E.g., how would you prove there are only four functions of type bool -&gt; bool in the STLC without function extensionality.

@jacobmcarthur It's easy if you talk about the denotation. There is a usual one, but you'll need funext. An LR is another, no funext needed.

@carloangiuli E.g. to show the Coq function bool -&gt; bool is equal to one of four functions, you need function extensionality.

@carloangiuli So any proof which interprets STLC directly in the metalanguage and proceeds from there probably needs funext? That's my guess
