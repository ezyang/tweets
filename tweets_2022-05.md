@austinvhuang If I only had C++98 I‚Äôd probably just pretend I was writing C with some extra features

@achernya I get to stop being cancelled when I redefine "good" to mean "useful" üòÇ

I'm about as big of a fan of stacked diffs as you can get (c.f. https://github.com/ezyang/ghstack) but if the first diff in your stack can't stand on its own, I'd much rather you squash the stack into one diff instead

You don't have to build the Right(TM) infra, you just need to get close enough to fall into the gravity well of user-driven success

Or as another example, @nelhage has advocated for property based tests to be treated like fuzzers, where generated inputs should be durably recorded https://blog.nelhage.com/post/property-testing-like-afl/

For example, let‚Äôs suppose you are doing a major rewrite / new implementation targeting an existing test suite and 50% of your tests are failing. You‚Äôd like your test framework to output the failing tests to be committed, so you can track as bugs get fixed and fails go away

Expect/golden tests having the capability to update their expected results automatically makes me wonder about other situations should collect data that gets durably recorded
