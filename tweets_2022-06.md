Also, I liked using alt arrows a lot to jump between words in the past but the default osx modifier key layout makes this awkward; what am I missing?

You can write a forward-only type checker as an abstract interpreter on the domain of types. Can you do an abstract interpreter for a bidirectional type checker?

Maybe this is the same thing as just reversing abstract interpreter? Or going both directions at the same time?

Suppose you have a family of sequences x0, x1, x2‚Ä¶ (parametrized by initial value) where you have both a step function xn+1 = f(xn) and a closed form solution xn = g(n, x0). Is there a way to automatically compute the closed form of the composition of two steps f1 and f2

That is to say you have xn+1 = f2(f1(xn)). The obvious composition of the closed forms g2(n, g1(n, x0)) is wrong as it is equivalent to applying all the f1s first, and then applying the f2s

@nathanewest I'm not exactly sure what exactly T0 and T1 are referring to here, but as far as LR schedulers are concerned, an epoch is whatever you want it to be (but by default every time you step the LR scheduler that's a new epoch)
