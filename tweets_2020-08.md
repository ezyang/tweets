Unsure how to structure the data of your code? Aim to represent meaning (that matters to your problem!): most of the other problems will work themselves out along the way!

How does one become a floating point expert? E.g., how does one get to the point where you can decide whether or not to replace cos(x) with sqrt(1-sin(x)^2) and you know it will be profitable AND numerically stable?

@fryguybob This is so cool! But it did something weird when I gave it a trig identity: https://herbie.uwplse.org/demo/d999b380bd0c4943898c340c827c222b103a11f1.cd03acd15d439869dfb902ddc25712e324e4c499/graph.html

@pavpanchekha @AChourdia and I were wondering about how Herbie computes error of trig functions; it seems to say there are zero bits of error for the expression 'sin(x)', but is that actually true for most library implementations of these functions?

@pavpanchekha @AChourdia Perhaps the answer is, there is error, but it's small enough that you can't see it in the chart. Compare https://herbie.uwplse.org/demo/f9ae411171a0cff0162658622c2235ef1b438865.cd03acd15d439869dfb902ddc25712e324e4c499/graph.html

Finished Eghbal's "Working in Public". Personal takeaway: code is zero marginal cost, but the means of production is a (by default) non-excludable and rivalrous common good. Treat software as a positive externality of the living open source process!

Had a lightbulb moment about algebraic effects reading https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05923 - the continuation passed into the algebraic effect handler is isomorphic to the syntax tree (aka the free algebra)

When we say effect handlers are folds over computation trees, we don't mean syntax trees; we mean trees where the children are the continuations of the operation in question
