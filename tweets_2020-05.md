In Racket, is it more idiomatic to use empty?/first/rest or pattern match on lists

So I was thinking to myself, "How the heck do you define logic programs that are guaranteed to terminate even when there are no solutions" and it turns out that this is pretty hard and you can write papers about it, e.g. http://okmij.org/ftp/Prolog/Arithm/arithm.pdf

In this paper, the general recipe is "computing bidirectional bounds from arguments of unknown instantiatedness...the key to decidable multiplication is to limit the search using bounds that the inputs place on each other, without testing whether any input is instantiated."

"Finite domain propagation" is a lot more similar to how humans do logic puzzles than SAT solving (which is way more brute force)

Writing a type checker in 30 lines of miniKanren is a great parlor trick. And then you have a program that can synthesize a term given a type!

TIL you can use partial template specializations to do pattern matching on types in C++. template&lt;... variables bound by pattern ...&gt; class A&lt;... the pattern ...&gt; { ... payload ... }. You can do as many parameter packs as you want.
