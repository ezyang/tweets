Apparently, dclabels is just dynamically enforced linear logic. Wow!

Amusingly enough, GHC only recently got segmented stacks (the situation is a little different there, though) https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2013-November/006314.html

@SCombinator We roll our own. Actually, are stacks aren't even what you'd normally consider the C stack, so it's not apples-to-apples

@cartazio Why would you want to? GHC's stack chunks are for GC, but C stacks don't need to be GC'd

@cartazio Yes, but it's not like we're starving for registers on x86_64
